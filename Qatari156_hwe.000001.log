Warning: 1388 het. haploid genotypes present (see Qatari156_hwe.000001.hh );
many commands treat these as missing.
Total genotyping rate is 0.998816.
Warning: --hwe observation counts vary by more than 10%, due to the X
chromosome.  You may want to use a less stringent --hwe p-value threshold for X
chromosome variants.
--hwe: 0 variants removed due to Hardy-Weinberg exact test.
67735 variants and 156 people pass filters and QC.
Among remaining phenotypes, 0 are cases and 66 are controls.  (90 phenotypes
are missing.)
