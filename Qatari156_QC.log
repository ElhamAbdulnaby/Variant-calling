Before main variant filters, 156 founders and 0 nonfounders present.
Calculating allele frequencies... done.
Warning: 1388 het. haploid genotypes present (see Qatari156_QC.hh ); many
commands treat these as missing.
Total genotyping rate is 0.998816.
0 variants removed due to missing genotype data (--geno).
Warning: --hwe observation counts vary by more than 10%, due to the X
chromosome.  You may want to use a less stringent --hwe p-value threshold for X
chromosome variants.
--hwe: 0 variants removed due to Hardy-Weinberg exact test.
0 variants removed due to minor allele threshold(s)
(--maf/--max-maf/--mac/--max-mac).
67735 variants and 156 people pass filters and QC.
Among remaining phenotypes, 0 are cases and 66 are controls.  (90 phenotypes
are missing.)
--make-bed to Qatari156_QC.bed + Qatari156_QC.bim + Qatari156_QC.fam ... done.
